If Sundarban Shopping had heavy debts or consistent losses, those debts would be liabilities for Amazon.
For example, Sundarban Shopping borrows huge amounts of money to expand, and Amazon guarantees the loan. 
That debt is Amazonâ€™s liability.If Sundarban Shopping consistently loses money (revenue < expenses), 
Amazon might need to cover the losses. 
These ongoing cash outflows become a financial burden and act like a liability.
If Sundarban Shopping faces lawsuits, fines, or penalties in Bangladesh, Amazon would be responsible for paying them.
